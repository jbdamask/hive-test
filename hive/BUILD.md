# How we build

John says what to see; agents write the spec and build it. Labels on the GitHub issue say where each request is: `drafting`, `pending_approval`, `approved_spec`, `proposal`, `in_progress`, `bug`. `python3 hive/tools/issue_check.py` tells the lead which issues need it, so John never has to say an issue exists.

## The flow
1. **John states the feature** in a GitHub issue: a sentence or a paragraph on the outcome wanted. The lead labels it `drafting`. An issue labelled `bug` skips the spec and goes to hive/FIXES.md.
2. **A spec writer writes the spec in two parts.** For agents, a file `hive/specs/<issue number>-<short name>.md`: John's words at the top, word for word; what will be built; the acceptance, which anyone can check with a yes or no; how each check in hive/PROJECT.md "Checks every feature passes" will be met; how it serves the product test; and a `DECIDED:` line for every question John's goals settle. For John, the issue body: a brief of at most 200 words in five parts (You asked for, You will get, You will not get, Cost, Decide) that links the file and passes `python3 hive/tools/spec_brief.py <issue number>`. Cost is tasks and money, never days or hours. Decide holds at most three questions only John can answer (hive/TEAM.md "Who decides"), each with a recommendation. Where the feature changes what a user does, an experience designer then writes the user's steps into the spec (hive/EXPERIENCE.md). A red team agent that wrote none of it tries to show it is wrong (hive/RED-TEAM.md). The spec is revised once; the lead settles the rest, and what only John can settle becomes a Decide question. The lead swaps `drafting` for `pending_approval`.
3. **John approves by adding the label `approved_spec`,** which accepts every recommendation. To answer a question differently, first comment with its number and the answer; the lead records it in the spec file. An issue without that label is not work.
4. **The lead breaks it down** with `/beads-planner:issue-to-beads <issue number>`, which reads .beads/PLANNING.md: one epic whose title carries `#<number>` and whose acceptance is the spec's, one bead per one-shot task. The lead removes `pending_approval` and adds `in_progress`.
5. **One-shot agents build the beads** (the agent brief).
6. **Done is the epic's acceptance met on the running product.** A red team agent first tries to show the evidence does not hold. Then the lead comments on the issue in at most 150 words (what John can now see and where, what changed for the user, anything left over), puts the full evidence in the spec file and closes the issue; John reopens it to disagree.

- What John asks for is the requirement, never a hypothesis: build it to the words as written and report what it changed.
- If building shows the spec is wrong for the user, the agent writes a `PREMISE:` note and the lead takes it to John the same day.

## The product test
One test says whether the product is worth using: hive/strategy/PRODUCT-TEST.md. The strategist owns it and reports its result and age each week. No milestone is called done on how much shipped.

## New ideas
The weekly idea round (hive/STRATEGIST.md) files at most two issues labelled `proposal`. John says yes by removing the label, which makes it a request like any other. Nothing is built from a proposal.

## Changing the rules
- A rule file changes when John says so, or to record a fact about a tool. A new rule line replaces an old one; the total in `python3 hive/tools/team_use.py rules` does not rise.
- A mistake made twice gets a mechanism (a hook that refuses, a test, a setting, removing the option), never one more sentence. If none is possible, the lead tells John.
- Each week the gardener (hive/GARDENER.md) reports what the rules cost and whether agents use them, and proposes cuts as one batch.
- Edit a role's brief in its source file, then run `python3 hive/tools/roles.py build`; the brief is rebuilt with `python3 hive/tools/brief.py build`.
